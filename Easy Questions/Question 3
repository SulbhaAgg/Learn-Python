Q: Sum of two lowest positive integers

Solution: 

def sum_two_smallest_numbers(numbers):
    #your code here
    
    arr = []
    import sys
    first = 2147483647 
    second = 2147483647 
    
    
    for x in numbers: 
        if first > int(x):
            second = first 
            first = x 
        elif second > x:
            second = x 
            
    return first+second

Solution: 
def tribonacci(signature, n):
    #your code here
  num = []
  
  if n <= 3 :
      for x in range(n): 
          num.append(signature[x]) ''
      return num 
  
  for x in signature:
      num.append(x)
 
  for x in range(3,n):
      num.append(num[x-1]+num[x-2]+num[x-3] )
      
  return num
